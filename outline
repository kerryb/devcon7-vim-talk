First impressions of vi
  - very basic
  - how do I type?
  - how do I quit?

Vim is not vi
  - more powerful
  - more customisable
  - optionally window-based rather than terminal

Some features you'd expect from a modern editor
  - tabs
  - splits
  - line wrap
  - spell check
  - still a learning curve!

Language-aware
  - colour
  - indentation
  - syntax checking

Not an IDE
  - probably wouldn't use for Java etc
  - a lot of tasks (inc dynamic languages) don't need/benefit from IDE
  - and it's a much better text editor (once you can use it)
  - there are ways of combining the two

Why am I claiming it's a better editor?
  - inputting vs editing
  - inputting is easy
  - vim excels at editing

Modes
  - start in normal mode
    - accepts commands to move cursor and operate on text
    - all keys available
  - insert mode
    - everyone knows you can enter with a or i
    - lots of other ways too
  - command
    - run commands (duh)
    - eg open, save, quit, search and replace
    - linewise operations
    - many many more!
    - shell commands
  - visual
    - select words or lines
    - block select
      - quadruple-click!

Movement
  - simple up/down/left/right
  - h,j,k,l, but arrows work too!
  - words, sentences and paragraphs
  - find (text/character)

Actions
  - do something while moving
  - yank, delete, paste
  - change
  - up/downcase
