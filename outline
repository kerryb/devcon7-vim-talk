Basic vi
  - how do I type
  - how do I quit?

Vim is not vi
  - more powerful
  - more customisable

Not an IDE
  - probably wouldn't use for Java etc
  - a lot of tasks (inc dynamic languages) don't need/benefit from IDE
  - and it's a much better text editor (once you can use it)
  - there are ways of combining the two
